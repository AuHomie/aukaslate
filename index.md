##Welcome to the party.

 Here is the long story. I’ll post the short one in a table. I am currently a student at weber state university studying computer science. Before I decided to come back to school, I had a few interesting jobs that lead me here. Including but not limited to, bartending, babysitting, (ya know the classics), I worked at an Albertsons as a bagger and eventually a non-foods employee. For the love of all things, please don’t bounce the big rubber balls! I worked and managed a summer sell call floor. (Once again babysitting.) I ended up going to school for phlebotomy, landing a job at the same hospital I did an internship at. I worked there for 10 years. I learned and was trained in many things. The titles I held as the following: phlebotomist, IV tech, lab assistant, admitting, courier and emergency on call courier. I was offered many times lead possessions within the lab department. I declined the offers because I did not have long term plans within the hospital. 

During my time at the hospital, I attended Master Esthetician school. I finished early and had the highest scores in my graduating class. I started and still run my own business taking a limited number of clients for skin treatments and several for retail. Life continued and my friends and I decided to make trades for different types of services. I decided to learn how to do piercings. It was not a far step from Iv’s and my work at the hospital. I have been doing this for 2 years now and I do enjoy it. I now realize that I need to obtain an education that I can provide a stable income to make my life what I want it to be.so here I am. In school again. I will say that I really enjoy school.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
